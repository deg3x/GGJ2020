# GGJ2020
Code assets for our global game jam 2020 entry, **PleBOT 3000**.

While in a kinda dirty condition (game jam standards :) ) the player controller\
includes the following functionality:

* Custom 2.5D movement
* Custom collision detection (utilizing Nvidia PhysX API and 3D volume checks)
* Custom physics (gravity and ground snapping)
* Fancy sinusoidal player bullets 

Hence no engine modules are being used except default colliders.\
(No rigid bodies, no character controller components etc.)

There also exists a bug/feature in the enemies functionality that makes the 10th\
wave impossible to defeat.
